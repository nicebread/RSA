Description: Advanced response surface analysis. The main function RSA compares
    several nested models (full polynomial, shifted and rotated squared
    differences, rising ridge surfaces, basic squared differences) and provides
    plotting functions for 3d wireframe surfaces, interactive 3d plots, and
    contour plots. Calculates many surface parameters (a1 to a4, principal
    axes, stationary point, eigenvalues) and provides standard, robust, or
    bootstrapped standard errors and confidence intervals for them.
